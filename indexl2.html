        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe training and placement team believes in the thought, “The outcome of education is apparent when careers sharpen your horizons” and we strive every minute working on it. Students’ skills are molded through multifarious training sessions that include technical, aptitude, verbal and soft skill. By understanding their level of grasping and delivering, the students are trained individually, based on their needs. To keep pace with the world, multiplicity of career is essential and that drives us to provide training and guidance for those who aspire to crack the competitive exams. </p>
